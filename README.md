### TILpad: Today I Learned pad

A minimalist weekly planning tool inspired by [Tweek](https://tweek.so/), built to practice React development and production engineering practices.

<!-- ## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# One-liner to get running
docker run -p 3000:3000 nnay29/tilpad
``` -->

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves two goals:
1. **Build** a clean, functional weekly planner for personal use
2. **Learn** professional development practices including:
   - React
   - Problem solving and Reverse-Engineering
   - CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
   - Testing (Vitest + React Testing Library)
   - Docker containerization
   - Production monitoring

## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nnay29/tilpad
cd tilpad

# Install dependencies

```

Note: Docker setup and deployment instructions coming soon.

## 📝 Development Practices
This project intentionally uses minimal AI assistance to maximize learning. Each feature is built by:

1. Understanding the requirement

2. Researching approaches (docs, articles, existing solutions)

3. Implementing manually

4. Adding tests and quality checks
